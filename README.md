# ⚡ GridEdge Compute Center – Hybrid Bitcoin + AI Financial Model

Welcome to the open-source financial modeling and pitch material 
repository for **GridEdge Compute Center** — a sovereign-grade Bitcoin 
mining and GPU hosting facility powered by geothermal and solar energy in 
El Salvador.

> Developed by **Bitcoin Mining Consulting LLC**

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

GridEdge is a 5MW hybrid compute facility designed to serve two critical 
sectors:

- **Bitcoin Mining (ASIC infrastructure):** Daily BTC generation using 
clean, low-cost energy from El Salvador’s volcano grid.
- **AI Compute Leasing (GPU infrastructure):** Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
(IaaS) for researchers, startups, and decentralized AI workloads.

The facility reuses waste heat through a wellness center (hydrotherapy + 
sauna) reducing OpEx while improving community well-being.

## 🌎 Strategic Context

> “$900B in annual data center CapEx by 2028 will rival the entire S&P500.” – Morgan Stanley  

> “AI infrastructure spend will reach $4 trillion by 2030.” – Jensen Huang, NVIDIA

The sovereign AI and Bitcoin infrastructure era is beginning. El 
Salvador's renewable energy, political will, and digital ecosystem offer a 
rare opportunity to build a geopolitically aligned compute center outside 
of traditional VC and surveillance models.

## 💰 Financial Overview

| Component             | Estimated Value      |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Total CapEx (Phase I)| $3.2M USD            |
| Revenue (GPU Lease)  | $80,000/month        |
| Revenue (BTC Mining) | $8–10K/month per MW  |
| Break-even Timeline  | ~3.5 years (base case) |

Power source mix: **70% Geothermal** + **Solar Redundancy** + **Grid 
Backup**
